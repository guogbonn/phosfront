                      In this Course, students will learn how to use a text-based programming language called Python. As of June 1st, 2022, Python has become the most popular coding language, and is used for web development, business automation, AI, and machine learning. Many major companies such as Google, Pixar, Netflix, Facebook, and Spotify build their products using Python. <br> <br> In this course, students will be introduced to the basics of this multi-dimensional language, as well as learn concepts and common terminology  applicable to Computer Science as a whole, including functions, variables, data types, loops, and operators.
                           Students will gain an understanding of Python by coding up solutions to real-world problems, led by an experienced software engineer as their instructor. Python is a great starter language for dipping your toes into coding for the first time, as the skills learned in this language seamlessly transfer to other programming languages.

                    <br> <br>
                    Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding Phostrino, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding Phostrino.

                  <p>
                    In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms and Conditions. Such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.
                  </p>

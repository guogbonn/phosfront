          <h5>Terms of Service</h5>
          <br>
          <p>  Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using the www.phostrino.com website and related products (collectively "Phostrino", “we”, “us”, or “our”).
            Access to and use of Phostrino is contingent upon acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use Phostrino. Anyone accessing or using Phostrino is agreeing to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms then you do not have permission to access Phostrino.
          </p>

          <h5>Purchases</h5>
          <br>
          <p> If you intend to purchase any product or service made available through Phostrino, you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to the purchase of product or service including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, and your billing address. Credit card information is always encrypted during transfer over networks.</p>
          ‍
          <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with the purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct, and complete.</p>

          <p>Phostrino may employ the use of third-party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of any purchase. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.</p>
          ‍
          <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons.</p>
          ‍
          <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if we have reason, in our sole discretion, to suspect fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>

          <h5>Coure Fees</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
          A valid payment method, such as a credit card is required to process the payment for your Course Fee. You shall provide Phostrino with accurate and complete billing information including, but not limited to, full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Phostrino to charge all Course fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments. <br> <br>

          Phostrino does and will not process charges that use an incorrect, expired, or over-the-limit credit card. We will try to contact you if this occurs. If you fail to pay any fees or charges when due, services or privileges may be suspended or terminated. You shall be responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys' fees and collection costs, that we may incur in its efforts to collect any unpaid balances from you. Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Phostrino will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice. </p>

          <h5>Fee Changes</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            Phostrino at any time may modify the Course fees for the Subscriptions. Any Course fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
            <br><br>
            Phostrino will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Course fees to give you an opportunity to modify or terminate before such change becomes effective.
            <br><br>
            Your continued use of Phostrino after the Course fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Course fee amount.
          </p>


          <h5>Refunds</h5>
          <br>
          <p>All sales are final. Phostrino will have sole discretion to consider refund requests on a case-by-case basis and determine refunds.</p>
